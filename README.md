# OmniFood

Welcome to OmniFood, the smart 365-days-per-year food subscription service that focuses on making people eat healthy again!

## About

OmniFood is a technology company with a primary focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. In today's fast-paced world, people are often overwhelmed with their jobs, family responsibilities, and social commitments, leaving them with little time for cooking. This lifestyle can lead to poor dietary choices and long-term health issues.

At OmniFood, we aim to address this problem by leveraging an AI-centric approach. Users can utilize our app to specify their dietary preferences, including likes and dislikes. Our AI algorithm then creates a personalized weekly meal plan tailored to each individual's needs.

But that's not all. We go a step further by partnering with restaurants and other cooking partners to prepare and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans. Currently available in selected cities, our service offers users the convenience of receiving nutritious meals at their doorstep.
